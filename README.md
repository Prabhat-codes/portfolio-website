This is my portfolio website, made using humble inspirations from across the internet, as well as some of my own previous work.

## How to use

1. Clone/Download the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start` to spin the up the local dev server port 3000.(http://localhost:3000).
4. Make required changes in `src/resumeData.js` to suit your needs.

# Note to self :

Once you've changed what you want in the master branch, run npm run deploy and that will deploy the same.
